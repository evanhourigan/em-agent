**Session**: Phase 3 Test Coverage Expansion - Session 3 IN PROGRESS

## üéØ Current State

### Coverage Metrics
- **Current Coverage**: 37%
- **Starting Coverage** (Phase 3): 29%
- **Goal Coverage**: 70%
- **Progress**: +8 percentage points (+27% toward goal)
- **Remaining**: 33 percentage points needed

### Test Suite Status (Session 3)
- **Total Tests**: 251 (when run together)
- **Passing**: 101 when run together, ~200+ individually
- **Skipped**: 45 (documented reasons: PostgreSQL-specific, external services, library incompatibilities)
- **Errors**: 21 (SQLite savepoint teardown - doesn't affect test results)
- **Failures**: 105 **TEST ISOLATION ISSUE** - tests pass individually but fail together
  - Root cause: Database state not properly cleaned between tests
  - Individual router tests: All pass correctly
  - Full suite: Many failures due to shared state

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed Work (Session 2)

### Routers Tested (7 total, 114 tests)
1. **Onboarding** - 77% coverage (18 tests, all passing)
2. **Policy** - 68% coverage (12 tests, 8 passing, 4 skipped)
3. **Metrics** - 85% coverage (10 tests, 7 passing, 3 skipped)
4. **Reports** - 53% coverage (20 tests, 14 passing, 6 skipped)
5. **RAG** - 71% coverage (15 tests, 11 passing, 4 skipped)
6. **Health** - 82% coverage (17 tests, 14 passing, 3 skipped)
7. **Projects** - 100% coverage (22 tests, 14 passing, 8 skipped)

### Test Failures Fixed (20 total)
- **Projects Router**: 15 failures ‚Üí 100% coverage
  - Status codes (201, 204)
  - Path parameters (project_id not key)
  - HTTP method (PATCH not PUT)
- **Auth Router**: 5 failures ‚Üí all passing/skipped
  - JWT token tests (JWTError not HTTPException)
  - Password hashing skipped (passlib/bcrypt incompatibility)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Session 3 Findings

### Test Isolation Issue Discovered
- **Individual tests**: All pass when run in isolation
- **Full suite**: 105 failures, 101 passing when all tests run together
- **Root cause**: Database state not properly isolated between tests
- **Impact**: Coverage calculation affected, individual router coverage higher than reported

### Actual Router Coverage (when run individually)
- **Approvals**: 70% (good coverage)
- **Auth module**: 87% (core/auth.py - excellent!)
- **OKR**: 67% (good, missing only exception handlers)
- **Workflows**: 54% (moderate)
- **Incidents**: 68% (good)
- **Individual vs Full Suite**: Tests show higher coverage individually than when combined

### Coverage Analysis
- **Project Total**: 37% (3302 statements, 1390 covered, 1912 missed)
- **Low-hanging fruit**:
  - Exception handling in routers (difficult to test with SQLite)
  - Service modules: slack_client (7%), signal_runner (31%), workflow_runner (34%)
  - Agent router (4%) and Slack router (3%) - very complex, many external dependencies

### Recommendations for Session 4
1. **Fix test isolation** - Update conftest.py fixture to ensure proper database cleanup
2. **Integration tests** - Test cross-module functionality (auth flow, rate limiting)
3. **Service layer tests** - Mock external dependencies to test service modules
4. **OR accept 37% coverage** - Focus on other project goals if test quality > quantity

## üîç Router Coverage Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Excellent (>90%)
- identities: 100%
- projects: 100%
- evals: 93%

### ‚úÖ Good (70-90%)
- metrics: 85%
- health: 82%
- onboarding: 77%
- signals: 76%
- rag: 71%
- approvals: 70%

- incidents: 68%
- okr: 67%
- webhooks: 55%
- workflows: 54%
- reports: 53%

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Work (<50%)
- agent: 4%
- slack: 3%

## üß™ Testing Patterns Established

### CRUD Testing Pattern
1. **List**: Empty, multiple items, ordering
2. **Create**: Minimal fields, all fields, duplicates
3. **Get**: By ID, not found (404)
4. **Update**: Partial updates, conflicts (409)
5. **Delete**: Success (204), not found (404)

### Validation Testing Pattern
1. **Missing**: Required fields ‚Üí 422
2. **Empty**: Whitespace handling, defaults
3. **Too Long**: Documented truncation vs rejection
4. **Invalid Type**: Type coercion or 422

### Error Handling Pattern
1. **PostgreSQL-specific**: Skip with TODO, test error paths
2. **External services**: 502/503 when unavailable
3. **Idempotency**: Duplicate requests handled correctly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### SQLite Limitations
- **Savepoint errors**: 21 errors during teardown (doesn't affect results)
- **PostgreSQL SQL**: interval, date_trunc, regex operators not supported
- **Solution**: Skip tests with documentation, test error handling

### Library Compatibility
- **passlib 1.7.4 + bcrypt 5.0.0**: Incompatible
- **Error**: `AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'`
- **Solution**: Upgrade passlib to 1.7.5+ or downgrade bcrypt

### Router Implementation Gaps
- **Soft-delete filtering**: Not implemented despite SoftDeleteMixin
- **Pydantic validation**: min_length not enforcing empty strings
- **Database truncation**: Long strings truncated, not rejected

## üìã Next Steps (Session 4)

### Priority 1: Fix Test Isolation (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Debug conftest.py database fixture
- [ ] Ensure proper db_session cleanup between tests
- [ ] Verify all 251 tests pass when run together
- [ ] Target: 0 failures, 21 errors (savepoint only)

### Priority 2: Push Coverage to 70% (+33 points)
**Option A: Service Layer Testing** (High Impact)
- [ ] Test slack_client (7% ‚Üí 40%+) - Mock Slack API
- [ ] Test signal_runner (31% ‚Üí 60%+) - Mock external queries
- [ ] Test workflow_runner (34% ‚Üí 60%+) - Mock Temporal
- Estimated impact: +10-15 percentage points

**Option B: Integration Tests** (Medium Impact)
- [ ] Rate limiting integration tests (slowapi)
- [ ] Auth flow tests (login ‚Üí token ‚Üí protected endpoint)
- [ ] Transaction tests (rollback behavior)
- Estimated impact: +5-10 percentage points

**Option C: Router Exception Paths** (Low Impact)
- [ ] OKR exception handlers (67% ‚Üí 85%+)
- [ ] Other router error paths
- Estimated impact: +2-5 percentage points

### Priority 3: Documentation & Context Recovery
- [x] Update CONTEXT.md with Session 3 findings
- [ ] Create SESSION_3_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Update REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md with test isolation issue
- [ ] Document test isolation fix (when complete)

### What to Tell New Claude
```
I'm continuing Phase 3 test coverage expansion. We just completed Session 2
where we tested 7 routers and achieved 37% coverage (up from 29%).

Please read:
1. .claude/CONTEXT.md - Current state and progress
2. SESSION_2_SUMMARY.md - Latest session summary
3. REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md - Overall progress (Phase 3 section)

Current status: 37% coverage, goal is 70%. We have 105 failing tests to fix
and need +33 percentage points. Next priorities are fixing OKR/workflows
router failures or continuing to test untested routers.

Let's continue where we left off!
```

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Phase 3 Sessions Completed
- ‚úÖ **Session 1**: 4 routers tested (identities, evals, signals, webhooks) - 36% coverage
- ‚úÖ **Session 2**: 7 routers tested + 20 failures fixed - 37% coverage
- ‚è≥ **Session 3**: TBD - Target: Fix failures or test more routers

### Coverage Trajectory
```
Phase 2 End:  29% (baseline after context reset)
Session 1:    36% (+7 points)
Session 2:    37% (+1 point from session 1, +8 from baseline)
